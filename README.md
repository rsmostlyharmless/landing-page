Learning is knowledge

This is just a practice project I have been working on while studying with The Odin Project.

I am a big fan of Deadpool so thought I would base this project around him.

The images used are by multiple artists that I have either photographed the original at home to use or I found online.

The first image in the top left corner (of an Octopus) is a painting by Amy Lightowlers. She painted this in our apartment and is based on me and the things I love.

The next image I used is of deadpool giving a 'peace' sign I found on pixabay.com. I am not sure who made this image as the account is listed as inactive, ID 19299194, but I hope they are still creating as I like their work.

Next is the first background image I used which is the Deadpool logo. This was also found on pixabay.com. The image was created by Aasif_saifi. 

These next four images, which are of a toy Deadpool posing in different positions, I found on unsplash.com and were made by an artist called Mulyadi. Mulyadi has a lot of great varied content on his profile which worth having a look through.

The second background image I used is actually an original signed print that was a birthday present for me from Amy Lightowlers (mentioned above). The artist is called Gibson Grey, creator of the books Lloyd and the bear. Me and some friends met Gibson at the first KaPow Comic-con and then had a very drunken, but amazing, night with him and his parner. Amy contacted Gibson a few years later and asked him to make this amazing image for me. He presented it to me himself and signed it after Amy brought me tickets to a different comic-con where Gibson has a table selling his comics and art. Great man!

The final image on the page I found on unsplash.com by an artist called Rachit Khurana. A perfect example of Deadpool breaking all walls of his universe by entering someone elses.
